                        <h3>R&B</h3>
                        <p>
                            To start off the list we have my third favorite genre, R&B. 
                            R&B is a top three favorite genre for me for many reasons, but here are a few of the main ones:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Always puts me in a chill mood.</li>            
                            <li>Easy to listen to.</li>
                            <li>My favorite R&B artist is Sampha.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Alternative Rock</h3>
                        <p>
                            My second favorite genre is Alternative Rock. 
                            Here is why I think it is the second best genre:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Always hypes me up!</li>            
                            <li>One of the hardest hitting music genres.</li>
                            <li>My favorite alternative rock artists are Jack White and Twenty One Pilots.</li>

                        <p>Twenty One Pilots is a fun band because of the interactive lore behind the songs.</p>
